Password Author

In this assignment we were tasked to create a password generator that returns a password based on criteria prompted and confirmed in the browser when clicking the generate password button. In my code I was able to create a code that succesfully asked the user specifications for their password and return a value in the box based on how many characters they chose and what kind of characters they want included.

Source code for line 26 to 41 in the script.js file was given by a tutor to get the values in the prompt function to return when used in genereatePassword function.
